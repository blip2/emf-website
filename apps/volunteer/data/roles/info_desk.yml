  Be a point of contact for attendees. Either helping with finding things or
  just getting an idea for what's on.
  
  The information desk is the first place people come to with questions, you'll
  have a set of answers to commonly asked questions, ranging from "where are the
  toilets" (see the map) to "where can I put my pulse jet" (far away from people).
  
  For the questions we haven't thought of yet you'll have contact details for
  people who can get the answers.
