name: Volunteer Welfare Assistant

full_description_md: >-
  Welfare assistants look after our volunteers, going round locations which have
  volunteers doing shifts to check that they're ok, and helping to resolve any
  problems that they're having.

  This could involve coordinating with the volunteer desk to find relief for
  someone, reporting issues that have occurred, or just making sure people have
  something to eat and drink.

  You'll need to be reasonably mobile as this role involves a lot of walking
  around the site, and enjoy talking to people. Otherwise no particular skills
  are needed, you'll be given a full briefing when you arrive for your first
  shift, and a way of contacting people for help if needed.
