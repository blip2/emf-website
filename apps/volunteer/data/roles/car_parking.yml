full_description_md: >-
  Help park cars, and get people on/off site.
  
  This role can involve quite a lot of walking, and standing in the sun and/or rain,
  but it is also super useful, and can be picked up very quickly.
  
  You need to make sure that the Accessible Parking is kept clear for those that
  need it. We do not require any proof that someone needs to use accessible
  parking; if they say they do - they do.
