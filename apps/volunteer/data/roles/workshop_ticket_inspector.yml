  Ticket inspectors manage the queue for workshops, checking that the people
  arriving have a ticket, and making sure there aren't more people waiting for
  last minute seats than will be able to get one.

  **You will need to be approved, and taught how to check tickets before any
  shifts. Please email <workshops@emfcamp.org> or speak to a member of the
  workshop team.**
