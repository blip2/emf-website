description: Coordinate between the stage and content teams
full_description_md: >-
  Venue managers are responsible for the main stages while talks are running. They
  coordinate between the stage and content teams to make sure any special
  requirements from speakers are accommodated, either resolve or escalate any
  technical issues, and make sure the stages are operating safely.

  You'll need to be able to communicate clearly with multiple teams, and calmly
  deal with problems in a fast paced environment.
