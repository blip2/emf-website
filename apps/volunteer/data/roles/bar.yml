  You will not be able to sign up for this shift unless:

  * You are over 18
  * You have completed [this short online course](https://www.emfcamp.org/volunteer/bar-training)
  
  ## What you'll be doing
  
  The bar team will be running two bars at EMF, the main bar will be to the north
  of the site near Stage B, the 2nd bar will be in the Null Sector.
  
  There are loads of benefits to volunteering on the EMF bar:
  
  1. Serving your fellow festival-goers and working with a team of volunteers 
     in the fast paced environment behind the bar is a great way to meet new
     people and socialise, it doesn't really feel like work at all.
  2. It's a great way to learn how to work on a bar and get experience if you
     ever fancy a career change! We'll teach you everything you need to know on
     the job, it's really easy once you get started.
  3. Usually the bar shifts are pretty short so they're easy to fit in with other
     things you might want to do, you can even pop back later and help out if
     there's a big queue, and help get your friends served quicker.
     
  Working behind the bar is loads of fun, its not hard work, and without lovely
  people like you we'd have no bar, so volunteer for a shift or two, or even
  three!
