description: Looking after artists before, during, and after performances
full_description_md: >-
  Liasons look after artists who will be performing at EMF, acting as a point of
  contact to help them get everything set up to perform. They coordinate between
  artists, the music team, and the stage team to resolve any issues and make
  sure artists are where they need to be.

  **You will require approval before signing up for shifts, if you have previous
  experience working with performers in this way please email <stage@emfcamp.org>
  or find a member of the stage team.**
