full_description_md: >-
  The sound & lighting operators on our stages make sure speakers look and sound
  great, both in person and when recordings are watched online. You'll be working
  with the rest of the stage team to adjust audio levels, switch lighting states
  at the begning and end of talks.

  **Training sessions will be available daily and are a great opportunity to 
  learn more about live event production.**
